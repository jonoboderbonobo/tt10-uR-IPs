In Integrated Circuit Design. 
Explain the Circuit types, their function and their differences. When they are needed and when they are NOT needed and can therefore be excluded in the IC. Also Are some of those circuits below THE SAME, just with different names?

1. Supervisory circuits. like 
    1.1 Power-on-Reset (POR)
    1.2 Brownout-detect (BOD) 
    1.3 watchdog timer devices
2. Startup Circuits liek
    2.1 Current Injection Startup
    2.2 Resistor-Based Startup
    2.3 MOSFET Switch-Based Startup
    2.4 Diode-Based Startup
