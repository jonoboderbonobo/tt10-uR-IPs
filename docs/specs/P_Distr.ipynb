    "- **Voltage Level (Displacement):** As high as possible for maximum displacement. At this scale, it is limited by the breakdown voltage of the piezo actuator rather than MOSFETs.\n",
    "- **Current Level (Speed):** Low enough resistance, i.e., high enough current for the respective oscillation frequency of the actuator. The limiting factors could be:\n",
    "    - Heat dissipation of MOSFETs inside the driver circuit\n",
    "    - Heat dissipation of the piezo crystal\n",
    "    - Frequency where actuation is efficient due to gait, friction, drag, and mechanical quality factor \n",
