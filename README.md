#  SuRF üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Piezoelectric Actuation Circuits
This tapeout is part of the [Open Source Mobile Microrobotics Framework SuRF üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è](https://github.com/jonoboderbonobo/surf/) and aims to provide Silicon Proven-, Tested-, Open Source-, Reusable Circuit-Blocks for Microrobots with On-Board Actuation. <br> <br>
If you are just here for the circuits you can skip to the [documenation](docs/documentation.md).
<br> <br>
If you are new to the field of **Microrobotics‚ù§Ô∏è** that's even better! For you I would recommend reading this current introduction file, before taking a deep dive into the [marvelous world of the microscale](https://github.com/jonoboderbonobo/surf/blob/main/barrier-free.md).

# What is a Mobile Microrobot?

```
    "A mobile microrobot [...] [is] a mobile robotic system where its untethered 
    mobile component has all dimension less than 1 mm and larger than 1 um 
    and its mechanics is dominated by microscale physical forces and effects."

# What can Microrobots used for?
There are currently five different fields where potential microrobotic applications could give an econimically advantage over existing prodcuts or prodecures. Either making them more secure, cheaper or possible in the first place. Those Fieldsa are Healthcare, Bioengineering, Micromanufacturing, Microfluidics, Mobile Sensor Networks, Mobile Sensor Networks[[1]](#1.2).
- Healthcare: 
    - [Cargo Delivery](https://pi.is.mpg.de/research_projects/cargo-drug-gene-etc) []()[]()[]()
    - [Surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimally_invasive_procedure) []()[]()[]()
    - [Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)](https://www.fusfoundation.org/the-technology/mechanisms-of-action/blood-brain-barrier-opening/) opening []()[]()[]()
    - [Biofilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm) removal []()[]()[]()
    - [Fertilazation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_fertilization) []()[]()[]()
    - [Embolization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization) []()[]()[]()
    - [Thromoblysis](https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/find-a-program-or-service/heart-and-vascular/vascular-surgery-and-endovascular-therapy/vascular-procedures/thrombolysis) []()[]()[]() 
- Bioengineering
- Micromanufacturing
- Microfluidics
- Mobile Sensor Networks

Additionally Environmental Remediation is also a possible application for microrobotics, but because of their relatively simplistic behavior, no need for communication and low-cost requirements, microrobots for Environmental Remediation will likely not include any CMOS Technology but rather manipulate existing Biological organisms or particles to achieve specific movement, reaction and replication.

# The lack of popularity of electronics
Many microrobotic researches see CMOS technology unsuited for microrobot applications [][][][][]. 
Those reasons can generally divided into short-term problems and long-term problems.
<br>
<br>

**Short-term problems:**
- Cost
- Power

**Long-term problems:**
- Reliabiity
- Versatility
- Scalability
### Cost
### Power
### Reliability
### Versatility
### Scalability

# The need for electronics

### Aquiring deeper understanding of the Micro- and Nanoworld
### Lowering cost of upcoming microrobotic products
