#  SuRF üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Piezoelectric Actuation Circuits
This is the initial approach for testing some circuits for the project
[Open Source Mobile Microrobotics Framework for Onboard Actuation (SuRF)üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è](https://github.com/jonoboderbonobo/surf/blob/main/README.md)
<br>
<br>
If you are well-versed in Microrobotics you can skip to the detailed information in SuRFsüèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [documentation](https://github.com/jonoboderbonobo/surf/blob/main/documentation.md. <br><br>
If you are just here for the electronic circuits in Tiny Tapeout 10 you can skip to the tt10-uR-IPs [documenation](docs/documenation.md).
<br> <br>
If you are new to the field of **Microrobotics‚ù§Ô∏è** that's even better! For you I would recommend reading this current introduction file, before taking a deep dive into the [marvelous world of the microscale](https://github.com/jonoboderbonobo/surf/blob/main/barrier-free.md).
## What is a Mobile Microrobot?

```
    "A mobile microrobot [...] [is] a mobile robotic system where its untethered 
    mobile component has all dimension less than 1 mm and larger than 1 um 
    and its mechanics is dominated by microscale physical forces and effects."
```

<br>


## What can Microrobots used for?
There are currently six different fields where potential microrobotic applications could give an econimically advantage over existing prodcuts or prodecures. Either making them more secure, cheaper or possible in the first place. Those Fieldsa are:
- Healthcare
- Bioengineering
- Micromanufacturing
- Microfluidics
- Mobile Sensor Networks
- Environmental Remediation
