#  $\text{Open Source Mobile } \mu\text{-robotics Framework}$  üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
This is the Alpha version of the "Open Source Mobile Microrobotic Framework" - SuRFüèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
<br>
<br>
If you are well-versed in Microrobotics you can skip to the detailed information in the projects [documentation](docs/main.md). <br><br>
If you are just here for the electronic circuits in Tiny Tapeout 10 I recommend skipping to the [circuit overview](docs/CO.md).
<br> <br>
If you are new to the field of **Microrobotics‚ù§Ô∏è** that's even better! For you I would recommend reading this current Introduction file, before taking a deep dive into the marvelous world of the microscale.
## What is a Mobile Microrobot?

```
    "A mobile microrobot [...] [is] a mobile robotic system where its untethered 
    mobile component has all dimension less than 1 mm and larger than 1 um 
    and its mechanics is dominated by microscale physical forces and effects."
``` 
[[1]](#1.1)
<br>
<br>

> **False Friends**  
> When you are interested in sub-millimeter robots and look up some existing robots yourself, make sure to verify its dimensions before investing significant time into a specific paper or concept. <br><br>
Even in scientific publications, you will often encounter "microrobots" despite no dimensions beeing smaller than $1 \text{ mm}$. There is yet no standardized definition of the term _microrobot_ [[1]](#1.1). Additionally terms like micro, nano, AI or quantum are often used as buzzwords, not only for marketing but also for securing research funds, which encourages the ambigious and imprecise use of the word "micro".



## What can a Microrobots used for?
There are currently six different fields where potential microrobotic applications could give an econimically advantage over existing prodcuts or prodecures. Either making them more secure, cheaper or possible in the first place. Those Fieldsa are:
- Healthcare
- Bioengineering
- Micromanufacturing
- Microfluidics
- Mobile Sensor Networks
- Environmental Remediation
<br>
[[1]](#1.2)

Healthcare: <br>
like Cargo Delivery []()[]()[](), Surgery []()[]()[](), Blood-Brain Barrier [(BBB)](https://www.fusfoundation.org/the-technology/mechanisms-of-action/blood-brain-barrier-opening/) opening []()[]()[](), Biofilm removal []()[]()[](), fertilazation []()[]()[](), Embolization []()[]()[](), Thromoblysis []()[]()[]() and many more. 


<br>


## What types of On-Board Mobile Microrobots are there?
Even tho the former definition of mobile microrobots excludes alot of small robots and focusing only on On-Board robots excludes even more, there is still a vast variety of robots with completely different application, energy source, actuation method and locomoation method. But not many of those are beyond the concept stage. Thats the reason

Curerntly many research laboratories focus on manipulating micro-particles with external magnetic fields by using machines similar to an MRI-scanner. This has the big advantage to be able to realize real world medical applications in the coming years.



## Goals of SuRF üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The main goal of SuRF üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è is to propell the field of untethred mobile microrobotics to new heights. To achieve this goal multiple problems have been identified an will be attacked simultaniously.

### Manufacturing Prototype - Tiny Tapeout

"Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip." [[99]](#99) <br>
You can use [Skywater130 PDK](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/) and soon [IHPs](https://www.ihp-microelectronics.com/de) SG13G2 derived [BiCMOS 130nm PDK](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK-docs). <br>
Usage of those two PDKs is free of charge and required no NDA. Prototyping with Tiny Tapeout can also be significantly cheaper than conventional [Multi Project Wafer (MPW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-project_wafer_service) prototyping, depending on your requirements. You can compare [Europractice MPW Pricing](https://europractice-ic.com/schedules-prices-2025/) with [TinyTapeout Pricing](https://app.tinytapeout.com/calculator?tiles=1&pcbs=1).
